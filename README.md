# Taskz

In one of the manager training in Pathao, our ex-HR Sifat Hasan bhai took a session on how to manage the daily tasks effectively. In that session, he showed us an effective way to manage our daily tasks. In our day-to-day tasks we have some tasks that are very important and also considering the deadline also urgent. So we need to pick those tasks whenever we get the chance. Again some tasks are not urgent but they are important for us. So what can we do we can categorize our tasks into 4 separate categories. 

- Urgent & Important

- Urgent but Not Important

- Not Urgent but Important

- Not Urgent & Not Important

So putting our day to day task into these category helps us to prioritize which task should pick first and which kinds of task we can do in our leisure time as well. I use 4 trello boards and put my task there. 

So I was thinking why not create a separate app for this? So here is the Taskz. A simple task management app for you. You can modify the code to fulfill your needs. I tried to make it as simple as possible. For architecture pattern, I used clean code architecture here. 

Yes, lots of things can be improved. This is the first step to make it better. Will update it regularly from now on.

## Tools and Architecture

- [RiverPod](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod) for the state management
- [sqflite](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite) for Sqlite Database
- [uuid](https://pub.dev/packages/uuid) for generating unique task id
- [Scrollable positined list](https://pub.dev/packages/scrollable_positioned_list) 

For the architecture used clean code architecture approach to architect the structure.
